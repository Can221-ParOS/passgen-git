# simple-password-generator
A simple password generator written in python (python 3.8, but anything higher than python 3.6 will work). 
For more secure passwords, set a higher password length. 
Default password length is 16 characters.
One password is generated by default

Command line arguments:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  --number NUMBER, -n NUMBER
                        amount of passwords to generate

  --length LENGTH, -l LENGTH
                        length of the password to generate

  --mode MODE, -m MODE  changes password generation output. 0 is the default meant for standard use,
                        1 outputs a Secure Token String in hexadecimal format, and 2 outputs a UUID4 Secure       Unique String ID
	

In development, so if you have any problems or suggestions then open an issue detailing your thoughts.
Penetration testers are welcome to have a go at the passwords it generates. I would love some feedback on the actual security of the generated passwords.
